# CGrasp
This repository is the official implementation of the CGrasp model from 
our __3DV 2025__ paper:

**3D Whole-body Grasp Synthesis with Directional Controllability**
(https://gpaschalidis.github.io/cwgrasp/).

CGrasp is a generative model for hand grasp generation, conditioned on a given direction. The generated
hand follows the specified direction.

## Installation & Dependencies
Clone the repository using:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:gpaschalidis/cgrasp.git
cd cgrasp
```

```bash
conda create -n cgrasp python=3.9 -y
conda activate cgrasp
conda install pytorch=2.0.1 torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install "git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d.git@stable"

```
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
## Getting started


#### Mano models
- Download MANO models following the steps on the [MANO repo](https://github.com/otaheri/GrabNet) and save them in the folder "models", following the structure below:
```bash
     cgrasp
        └── models
              └── mano
```

#### GrabNet data (only required for retraining the model or testing on the test objects)
- Download the GrabNet dataset (ZIP files) from [this website](http://grab.is.tue.mpg.de). Please do NOT unzip the files yet.
- Put all the downloaded ZIP files for GrabNet in a folder.

- Run the following command to extract the ZIP files.

    ```Shell
    python cgrasp/data/unzip_data.py   --data-path $PATH_TO_FOLDER_WITH_ZIP_FILES \
                                        --ectract-path $PATH_TO_EXTRACT_DATASET_TO
    ```
- The extracted data should be in the following structure.
```bash
    GRAB
    ├── data
    │    │
    │    ├── bps.npz
    │    └── obj_info.npy
    │    └── sbj_info.npy
    │    │
    │    └── [split_name] from (test, train, val)
    │          │
    │          └── frame_names.npz
    │          └── grabnet_[split_name].npz
    │          └── data
    │                └── s1
    │                └── ...
    │                └── s10
    └── tools
         │
         ├── object_meshes
         └── subject_meshes
```

#### CoarseNet and RefineNet models
- To test CGrasp you need the pre-trained refinenet model from GrabNet. Download this model from the [GRAB website](https://grab.is.tue.mpg.de), 
and move it in the folder "pretrained" as described below.
```bash
     cgrasp
        └── cgrasp
              └── pretrained
                     └── refinenet.pt
```
## Train CGrasp
To train CGrasp from scratch use the following command:

```bash
python train.py --config_path cgrasp/configs/cgrasp_cfg.yaml --data_path GRAB/data/ --rhm_path models/mano/ --save_dir save
```

## Test Grasp
To try CGrasp and visualize the generated grasps together with the input grasp directions:

- First download our pre-trained model from [here]() and place it in the folder "pretrained". The folder "pretained" should have the follwing structure:
```bash
     cgrasp
        └── cgrasp
               └── pretrained
                     │ 
                     ├── pretrained_cgrasp_cfg.yaml
                     ├── cgrasp.pt                     
                     └── refinenet.pt
```                     
- And then run the following command after picking a ".ply" file from the path "GRAB/tools/object_meshes":

```bash
python generate_grasps.py GRAB/tools/object_meshes/{obj_name}.ply models/mano/ --config_path cgrasp/pretrained/pretrained_cgrasp_cfg.yaml
```
